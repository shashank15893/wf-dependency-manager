# Supply Chain Dependency Chart Implementation Guide

Based on your requirements for visualizing the data similar to the diagram you shared, I've created two different implementations that will provide you with the exact flowchart style you're looking for.

## Option 1: Custom SVG Flowchart

The first implementation (`flowchart-component.js`) uses custom SVG rendering to create a flowchart that matches your example. This approach:

- Creates rectangular nodes with rounded corners
- Displays parent-child relationships with connecting arrows
- Uses color-coding based on status (red for failed, green for completed, etc.)
- Implements interactive features like node selection and tooltips
- Connects to your MySQL database through the backend API

## Option 2: D3.js Flowchart

The second implementation (`d3-flowchart.js`) uses the powerful D3.js library to create a more sophisticated tree visualization. This approach:

- Leverages D3's tree layout algorithms for optimal node positioning
- Creates a hierarchy that closely resembles your example
- Provides smoother interactions and animations
- Includes tooltips with detailed node information
- Has better handling of complex tree structures

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
# For either implementation
npm install axios

# Additional for D3 implementation
npm install d3
```

### Step 2: Choose an Implementation

Choose one of the two implementation files:
- `flowchart-component.js` - Custom SVG implementation
- `d3-flowchart.js` - D3.js implementation

Copy your chosen file to your project's components directory and rename it to `SupplyChainDependencyChart.js` or import it directly.

### Step 3: Backend Setup

The backend setup remains the same as previously detailed:

1. Create a MySQL database using the provided script
2. Deploy the Express.js backend
3. Configure environment variables for the database connection

## How the Visualization Works

Both implementations follow the same basic process:

1. **Data Fetching**: Retrieves node data from the MySQL database via API
2. **Tree Building**: Converts the flat data structure into a hierarchical tree
3. **Layout Calculation**: Determines the position of each node in the visualization
4. **Rendering**: Draws the nodes and connecting arrows
5. **Interactivity**: Adds event handlers for user interactions

## Customization Options

Both implementations can be customized in several ways:

### Node Appearance

You can adjust node appearance by modifying the `getNodeColor` and `getTextColor` functions:

```javascript
const getNodeColor = (status) => {
  switch (status?.toLowerCase()) {
    case 'failed': return '#e74c3c'; // Change color for failed status
    case 'completed': return '#27ae60'; // Change color for completed status
    // ...
  }
};
```

### Layout and Spacing

Adjust the layout parameters to change spacing between nodes:

```javascript
// Custom SVG implementation
const horizontalSpacing = 250; // Increase for more spacing between siblings
const verticalSpacing = 100;   // Increase for more spacing between levels

// D3 implementation
const treeLayout = d3.tree()
  .size([width, height - 100]); // Adjust to change overall tree dimensions
```

### Node Content

Modify the node content to display different information:

```javascript
// In the node rendering section
<text
  x="100"
  y="35"
  text
